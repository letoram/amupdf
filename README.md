A-MuPDF
=======
This is a simple arcan-shmif based viewer for MuPDF. This repository is
intended as an incubation chamber for hammering out an integration that uses
most matching shmif features from the angle of using PDFs as a data source in
processing chains (e.g. pipeworld) or as document preview rather than perhaps a
full-fledged xPDF like replacement.

As such this repo isn't stable or something to package, when it is ready
enough it'll be added into the main arcan repository as part of afsrv\_decode
so that it integrates with things like the durden file browser.
